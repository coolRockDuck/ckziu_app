App created as a hobby project which was born during boring times of quarantine and develop further.
It's basically a better version of a school's website with extra features.
Main idea was to create an app which will
display lesson schedules in a better way than the original school's site,
but after some time other functionalities were added including
main page and displaying news regarding school.
